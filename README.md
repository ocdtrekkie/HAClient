# HAClient
HAClient is a fairly simple SMTP client in a UWP app, designed to issue commands to a HAController server via email. Essentially, this app saves you a couple clicks in having to compose an email in your normal email client.

This project was built with [Windows Template Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio) and [Lightbuzz SMTP](https://github.com/LightBuzz/SMTP-WinRT).
